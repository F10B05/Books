# **Systemfall: The Gatineau Chronicles**

### **Chapter 1: The End of the Old World**

The world held its breath on a cool, overcast Tuesday in late October 2024.

In the Vieux-Hull sector of Gatineau, Quebec, a crisp autumn wind rustled the last of the stubborn, colourful leaves. Life was normal. For **Elizabeth Sirois**, a federal employee who found solace in the quiet precision of her drawings, it was a day of mundane routine. For **Manson Thomas**, her partner and a practical hardware store specialist at the Rona on Boulevard de la Gappe, it was another day of stocking shelves, his mind filled with the survivalist lore he devoured in his spare time.

They were together in their apartment when it happened. It wasn't a loud bang or a blinding flash. It was a sudden, profound *silence*. The drone of traffic on the nearby Macdonald-Cartier Bridge, the hum of the refrigerator, the distant chatter from the market—it all vanished. Elizabeth looked up from her sketchbook, her eyes meeting Manson’s in shared confusion. A low, resonant hum filled the air, a vibration that started in their teeth and settled deep in their bones. Instinctively, Manson put a protective hand on her shoulder.

Then, just as suddenly as it began, the hum stopped. Floating in the air before their very eyes, a translucent blue box shimmered into existence, its text unnervingly clear: `[System Integration Initializing... 10%... 50%... 100%]`. It was followed by `[Planetary Assimilation Complete.]`, then the terrifying words, `[Welcome, User, to the Novus System.]`, and finally, a stark directive: `[The Tutorial Protocol is now active. Adapt, evolve, or perish.]`.

The messages hung there, the last remnant of the world they knew. `[Your new life begins now.]`

### **Chapter 2: Character Creation**

As the terrifying messages faded, new windows appeared, tailored to each of them. The Novus System, in its cold, omniscient way, had already analyzed their lives and quantified their existence.

For Elizabeth, the System displayed her new reality.
`[Character Sheet Initialized]`
`Name: Elizabeth Sirois`
`Level: 1 (0/100 EXP)`
`Title: N/A`
`Class: N/A`

`[Primary Attributes]`
`> Strength (STR): 8`
`> Dexterity (DEX): 11`
`> Constitution (CON): 9`
`> Intelligence (INT): 14`
`> Wisdom (WIS): 13`

`[Secondary Stats]`
`> HP: 90/90`
`> SP: 80/80`
`> Dodge Chance: 5%`
`> Critical Hit Chance: 2%`
`> Physical Damage Resistance: 1%`

*My mind is sharp, but I'm weak,* Elizabeth thought, a cold dread washing over her as she looked at her low physical stats. The world outside was already erupting into panicked shouts. Finesse and intellect might not be enough to survive. She glanced at Manson, his solid presence a small comfort in the face of the impossible.

Manson received his own grim assessment.
`[Character Sheet Initialized]`
`Name: Manson Thomas`
`Level: 1 (0/100 EXP)`
`Title: N/A`
`Class: N/A`

`[Primary Attributes]`
`> Strength (STR): 13`
`> Dexterity (DEX): 10`
`> Constitution (CON): 14`
`> Intelligence (INT): 9`
`> Wisdom (WIS): 15`

`[Secondary Stats]`
`> HP: 140/140`
`> SP: 130/130`
`> Dodge Chance: 2%`
`> Critical Hit Chance: 1%`
`> Physical Damage Resistance: 5%`

Manson looked at his stats with a grim sense of validation. He was strong, tough, and his practical wisdom was high. But his low Intelligence was a glaring weakness. *All the survival skills in the world won't help if you can't outthink whatever is coming. This isn't just about fighting monsters; this is a system. It has rules. I need to learn the rules to keep us safe.*

The System then offered them a choice of starting skills. Faced with the options, Elizabeth chose the one that felt most innate to her artistic soul: `[Steady Hand - Lvl 1]`. Whatever came next, precision would be an asset. Manson, seeing her choice, gave a small, approving nod. It was so *her*. His own choice was just as clear. Of the skills offered, one stood out as the only real option for a man who loved to test himself against the wild: `[Survivalist - Lvl 1]`. Elizabeth felt a wave of relief; in this terrifying new world, his hobby was no longer a game, but their single greatest advantage.

As they mentally confirmed their choices, a wave of information washed over them. For Elizabeth, a deep sense of calm settled into her hands, an impossible awareness of every muscle. For Manson, a flood of primal instincts, of intuitive knowledge about shelter, water, and tools.

Their home, once a sanctuary, now felt like a starting zone.

### **Chapter 3: First Steps**

A new, shared notification appeared, its objectives a stark contrast to the domestic peace of moments before.
`[Tutorial Quest Issued: First Steps]`
`Objective 1: Find a suitable weapon.`
`Objective 2: Secure a source of potable water.`
`Objective 3: Observe the new world from a safe location.`
`Time Limit: 8 Hours`

They exchanged a look. The kitchen knives were flimsy, the windows a terrifying portal. The answer was obvious. Preparation. Manson, with his survival instincts flaring, knew their best chance lay not in the kitchen but in the gear he had meticulously prepared for a day like this. He led them to the hall closet, pulling out his bug-out bag and a sturdy toolbox.

"Let's see what we've got," he said, his voice a low anchor in the rising sea of chaos outside. From the bag, he pulled a Lifestraw water filter and a hunting knife. From the toolbox, he retrieved a claw hammer, a sturdy **crowbar**, and a short, well-balanced hatchet.

He handed the hatchet to Elizabeth. She felt its weight and balance with perfect clarity, as if her **[Steady Hand]** skill made it an extension of her arm. The System confirmed the new item: `[New Item Equipped: Hatchet (Common)]`, `Damage: 10-15 (+STR Bonus)]`, `Durability: 50/50`.

The System registered the items, and their quest log chimed softly, two objectives instantly completed. Only one remained.

With weapons in hand, they approached the living room window. Elizabeth carefully pulled back the edge of the curtain just enough to see. The street was eerily quiet. And on the sidewalk, a pigeon pecked at the ground, its eyes glowing with the same faint blue light as their System windows. A small window popped into her vision: `[Observation Successful!]`, `> Name: Corrupted Pigeon | Level: 1 | Threat Level: Minimal`.

As she relayed the information, a triumphant chime sounded in their minds.
`[Tutorial Quest: First Steps - Complete!]`
`[Rewards Issued: 100 EXP, Basic Food & Water Rations x2]`

`[LEVEL UP!]`
`You have reached Level 2!`
`You have 5 unspent attribute points.`

A new quest immediately appeared: `[The Outside World]`, with the objective to travel to a designated Safe Zone at the **Palais de Justice** on Rue Laurier, a mere ten blocks away. It might as well have been a thousand miles.

Before facing the new world, they knew they had to be stronger. They sat back-to-back on the floor and focused on their blinking character sheets.

**Elizabeth's Level 2 Upgrade:**
*I'm not strong enough to make a difference in a real fight,* she thought, the memory of her own fragility fresh in her mind. *I need to be tougher. I need to be able to hold my own.* She decisively bolstered her physical stats, adding **+2 STR (10), +2 CON (11), and +1 WIS (14)**. As she confirmed the choices, she felt a solid, grounding warmth spread through her body. Her limbs felt sturdier, the hatchet in her hand less of a tool and more of a weapon. The world seemed to come into slightly sharper focus, the edges of things a little clearer.

**Manson's Level 2 Upgrade:**
Manson stared at his own stats, his earlier conclusion solidifying into a firm strategy. *Planning is better than fighting. Understanding is better than strength.* He made a profound, character-defining choice. He invested all **+5 points into his greatest weakness: Intelligence (14)**. The effect was not physical, but mental, and it was breathtaking. It was like a light switching on in a dim room; connections between ideas formed faster, and he could suddenly see the patterns in the chaos around them with a shocking new clarity. Elizabeth watched him, a knot of worry in her stomach, but squeezed his hand, trusting his judgment.

With their new power settled, they prepared to move.

### **Chapter 4: The Stalker**

The ten-block journey to the Palais de Justice was a forty-five-minute sprint through hell. They moved from car to alleyway, the sounds of screaming and crashing echoing through the streets of Vieux-Hull. Their path led them to a small dépanneur on Rue Wellington. A gamble for supplies was too tempting to ignore.

The moment they stepped inside, a low groan echoed from the back. A former cashier, its skin grey and eyes glowing with vacant blue light, shambled towards them. The System identified it as a **[Shambling Husk]**.

Their first fight. Adrenaline surged. Manson kicked a bag of chips to create a distraction, drawing the Husk's attention. The creature's head snapped towards the sound, a low, wet moan escaping its slack jaw. As it lurched past an aisle, Elizabeth exploded from cover. Fear gave way to focus as she brought the hatchet around in a vicious arc, her **[Steady Hand]** ensuring the blow landed true on the creature’s neck. There was a sickening crunch, and the Husk collapsed, its blue eyes fading to black. Manson stared, a flicker of awe on his face. The quiet artist he lived with had just become a stone-cold killer to protect them.

Victory. They had won, earning `50 EXP` and their first loot—a **[Corrupted Crystal Fragment]** and **3 Novus Coins**.

Their caution overrode their curiosity. Before scavenging, they secured the location, barricading the doors. Only then did they examine the loot, learning of the System's economy and its crafting potential. With the store secured, they performed a targeted search. Manson found high-energy food and utility items. Elizabeth located a first-aid kit and sealed water. They stored it all in their new System **[Inventory]**.

The journey continued. They bypassed a flock of `Corrupted Pigeons` by luring them away. Their next challenge was an unknown anomaly on their map. Peeking around a corner, they saw it: a corrupted dog, a **[Corrupted Stalker]**, its limbs too long, its eyes burning with predatory intelligence. The System confirmed it was **Level 3**.

They devised a daring ambush. Elizabeth climbed atop a recycling bin in a narrow alley, her heart pounding. Manson made a sharp noise, luring the Stalker into the kill box. The creature moved with a terrifying, silent speed. As it passed below, Elizabeth dropped, a surge of terror and resolve steeling her nerves as she sank her hatchet deep into its spine. The creature howled, a sound of pure agony and rage that echoed off the brick walls, and it twisted, still very much alive. It turned its furious gaze on Manson.

Elizabeth’s heart froze. *No!*

Thinking fast, Manson dropped his knife and wrenched the crowbar from his belt. As the Stalker lunged, he jammed the crowbar into its open jaws. The impact was jarring, the force of the beast threatening to overwhelm him. As it thrashed, one of its claws raked across his arm. `[Manson takes 35 damage! HP: 105/140]`. He held his ground, muscles screaming as he pinned the creature's head down with raw **[Leverage]**. Elizabeth watched in stunned relief, a new level of respect for his raw strength and quick thinking washing over her. He wasn't just the smart one; he was her rock. She scrambled to her feet and lunged, her hatchet finishing the job with a final, desperate strike.

The victory was costly but earned them another level-up, reaching **Level 3**.

Fearing the howl had attracted attention, they snatched the loot—including **[Stalker's Sinew]**—and fled, finding refuge in a quiet, fenced-in backyard. There, they finally allocated their points.

**Elizabeth's Level 3 Upgrade:**
*That thing was too fast,* she thought, the memory of its blinding speed and her own momentary helplessness replaying in her mind. *I was too slow to help him. Never again.* Her choice was a direct tactical response to the threat, adding **+3 DEX (14) and +2 CON (13)**. She felt the change as a sudden lightness in her limbs. Her body felt more responsive, her balance more certain. It felt as though the world had slowed down just a fraction, her own reflexes now a step ahead of it.

**Manson's Level 3 Upgrade:**
Manson's gambit with the crowbar had worked, but it was his intellect that led them there. He doubled down on his strategy. *A point of Strength for me helps one person. A point of Intelligence helps everyone.* He invested another **+5 points into Intelligence (19)**. The initial spark of clarity he'd felt before now broadened into a steady flame. He began to see the world not just as a collection of objects, but as a series of interconnected systems—the physics of a barricade, the structural weaknesses in a building, the probable path of a monster.

They were stronger, smarter, and finally, after a last, desperate sprint that earned them both `[Running - Lvl 2]`, they saw it: the fortified walls of the Palais de Justice. They had made it.

### **Chapter 5: The Museum of History**

Their arrival at the Safe Zone, now being called the Citadel, was followed by a brief period of integration and rest. They met the Citadel's pragmatic leader, **Administrator Rémi**, and the grizzled head craftsman, **Gus**. But their respite was short-lived. A scouting patrol had gone missing. Their last known position was the **Canadian Museum of History**, a mere 500 meters down Rue Laurier. The danger wasn't the distance, but the extreme concentration of System energy reported in the area. Rémi needed her best, and the two newcomers had already proven their worth.

Before accepting, they leveraged their success to gain access to Gus's "Artificer's Stash" of rare materials. With a new **[Uncommon Power Core]** in hand and only an hour before departure, Manson undertook a frantic, high-stakes craft. Gus watched, amazed, as Manson worked with a speed that should have been impossible, his hands a blur as he shaped metal and integrated the humming core into a scavenged gauntlet. The final fusion was a heart-stopping moment of risk, but his intellect held the volatile energies in check.

A notification announced his success: `[Item Crafted: Kinetic Overdrive Gauntlet]`.
`> Type: Gauntlet (Medium Armor)`
`> Quality: Rare`
`> Armor: 8`
`> Durability: 150/150`
`> Effect: +1 Strength, +1 Intelligence`
`> Active Ability: [Kinetic Pulse] - Costs 30 SP. Unleash a short-range blast of concussive force, staggering all enemies in a cone in front of you. (Cooldown: 5 minutes)`
`> Bonus Effect: [Energy Siphon] - Melee strikes with this gauntlet have a small chance to restore 1 SP.`
`> Crafted by Artificer Manson Thomas.`

Their new team was led by **Leo**, a tall, wiry veteran scavenger whose well-stocked pack seemed to hold an answer for every problem, and **Maya**, a silent, deadly archer. They took to the rooftops to cover the short but dangerous distance. Their path was blocked by a wide gap between buildings. The team held their breath as Maya, accounting for the wind and the drag of the attached **paracord** from Leo's pack, loosed a perfectly aimed arrow that secured their crossing. Elizabeth and Manson exchanged an impressed glance; these veterans were the real deal. They crossed, arriving at the museum roof. They found signs of the missing scouts, but the only way in was a massive, reinforced skylight. Manson, using his **[Deconstruct]** skill with surgical precision, dismantled the frame's locking mechanism, opening a silent path inside. Leo gave him a gruff, appreciative nod.

They rappelled down into the Grand Hall, an echoing cavern dominated by the iconic totem poles and the massive whale skeleton suspended from the ceiling. Following their quest to find a map, they moved to the lobby and found the scouts' tracks. They led to the **Canadian History Hall**, but there were no tracks leading back. A faint, rhythmic clicking emanated from the darkness ahead. Using a quickly crafted periscope, Manson spied the source: a **[Mannequin Sentinel]**, a Level 5 construct modeled after a War of 1812 soldier, patrolling before the slumped body of a scout. The Sentinel was powerful, but weak to blunt trauma.

They set an ambush. As the Sentinel passed, the sound of stone grinding on marble grating in their ears, Manson and Leo struck. The impact of their blunt weapons was like the crack of splitting rock. Elizabeth, now **Level 4**, surged forward, her System confirming her action: `[Elizabeth uses [Twin Strike - Lvl 1]! -15 SP]`. Her attack found the newly formed fractures and shattered the construct. The scout was alive, but they discovered he was bait for another, dormant Sentinel—a mannequin of a *coureur des bois* in a nearby diorama.

The team fell silent, all eyes on Maya. A notification appeared for them all: a high-difficulty `Called Shot` was required. One miss, and the construct would activate. Maya drew, held her breath until the world seemed to stop, and loosed her arrow. It whispered across the hall and struck the dormant Sentinel's neck joint with a sharp *crack*, shattering it before it could ever awaken.

The scout was not merely wounded; a **[Lesser Petrified Core]** was slowly turning him to stone. Manson, with the team covering him, performed a delicate operation, using his crowbar to carefully pry the "seed" loose, saving the man's life.

### **Chapter 6: The Curator**

With one scout rescued but two still missing, they pressed on, carrying their unconscious new charge. They found another scout dead, his armor cracked by heavy blows, and the path ahead forked, with a Sentinel patrolling each corridor. Committing to the left path, they set an ambush. But this Sentinel let out a piercing `[Alarm Shriek]`, a psychically grating sound that promised imminent doom. The second Sentinel was coming, fast. After a frantic battle, they defeated the first, the rapid *click-click-click* of the second growing louder by the second.

Falling back to a defensible alcove, they made their stand. Manson unleashed his gauntlet's **[Kinetic Pulse]**. A silent, gut-punching wave of force distorted the air, slamming into the charging Sentinel and staggering it. `[Manson activates [Kinetic Pulse]! -30 SP]`. The team surged forward in a desperate, brutal flurry, overwhelming and destroying it.

With both paths clear, Manson used his now-prodigious intellect to analyze the scuffed tracks. He deduced the story of the fight: the scouts had been ambushed, two had fled down the right path, one was killed, and the last was taken to be used as bait. Their path was clear.

They entered the "Age of Sail" exhibit and found the two remaining scouts, Corine and David, hiding in a massive ship replica. They learned the true threat: an intelligent, stealthy boss they called **"The Curator."**

Instead of retreating, the team made a bold choice: they would hunt the hunter. Using a priceless astrolabe from the exhibit as bait, they set a trap in the Grand Hall. The Curator, a grotesque fusion of the museum's former director and priceless artifacts from the History Hall, emerged from the shadows, moving with a silent, boneless grace. They sprung the trap with Manson's `[Kinetic Pulse]` `[-30 SP]`. The blast staggered the boss and interrupted its **[Shadow Step]** escape.

A furious battle ensued. The Curator was a Level ?? boss, a whirlwind of obsidian claws that scraped and sparked on the marble floor. It moved like a nightmare, wounding both Elizabeth and Manson. Their combat logs scrolled frantically in their vision.
`[COMBAT LOG]`
`> The Curator uses [Obsidian Claws] on Elizabeth!`
`> [DEX Check to Dodge... Success!] [Graceful Step] triggered!`
`> A glancing blow connects! Elizabeth takes 15 damage! HP: 115/130.`
`> Status Effect [Grievous Wound] applied!`

Elizabeth felt an unnatural cold seep into her arm from the debuff, her fury rising as she saw her partner in danger. The Curator then lunged at Manson. He took the direct hit that would have killed a lesser man, gritting his teeth as the claws tore across his chest.
`[COMBAT LOG]`
`> The Curator uses [Obsidian Claws] on Manson!`
`> Manson takes 78 damage! HP: 62/140.`

His sacrifice created the final opening. Pushing through the pain, Elizabeth took that opening, pouring her remaining energy into a final, precise `[Twin Strike]`.
`[Elizabeth uses [Twin Strike - Lvl 1]! -15 SP]`
`[Critical Hit! Weak Point Exploited!]`
`[The Curator has been defeated!]`

Her attack ended the Curator's reign of terror. Their victory was legendary.

`[UNIQUE BOSS DEFEATED: THE CURATOR]`
`[Massive EXP Gained: 1200]`

`[LEVEL UP!]`
`You have reached Level 5!`
`You have 5 unspent attribute points.`
`HP and SP have been fully restored. [Grievous Wound] status effect removed.`

The Curator dropped a hoard of rare loot, including a **Class Skill Book: [Shadow Step]** and the **[Museum Security Keycard]**.

### **Chapter 7: A New War**

Before leaving the museum, their curiosity got the better of them. They used the keycard to access the security office, where they found a significant prize: a `[Cavalry Saber (Uncommon)]` for Elizabeth, two `[Encrypted Transceivers (Rare)]`, and the `[Museum Utility Schematics]`. On a whim, they also did one last check of the office, discovering the final, chilling log of Dr. Alistair Finch, the former curator who willingly embraced the System to become the monster they just slew. The discovery earned them a permanent bonus: `[+1 Wisdom]`.

Elizabeth claimed the **[Shadow Step]** skill for herself. The book dissolved into motes of dark energy that flowed into her, granting her an intuitive understanding of shadow and space. A notification confirmed the new ability: `[New Skill Acquired: [Shadow Step - Lvl 1 (Active)] - Costs 35 SP.]`.

After reporting their success via transceiver, they learned a medical team would be waiting. Before leaving, they allocated their Level 5 points.

**Elizabeth's Level 5 Upgrade:**
Now an elite fighter, her focus was on perfecting her craft. She boosted her physical stats across the board, adding **+2 STR (15), +2 DEX (19), and +1 CON (14)**. She felt a surge of power settle into her muscles and sinews, a perfect harmony of strength and speed. The world seemed to move in slow motion, her control over her body and her new saber now absolute.

**Manson's Level 5 Upgrade:**
He was on the cusp of a breakthrough. His intellect was his greatest weapon, and he pushed it to the absolute limit, investing another **+5 points into Intelligence (29)**. The experience was reality-altering. As his Intelligence crested a new threshold, the very code of the System seemed to become visible to him. He could see the faint, glowing lines of energy in his gauntlet, the complex web of enchantments on Elizabeth's saber, the subtle flow of power through the air itself. It was like seeing in a new color. This final push triggered a System milestone: his `[Basic Crafting]` skill evolved into the passive `[Artisan's Intuition]`.

Their return was triumphant. Greeted as heroes, they delivered the rescued scouts to Dr. Aris in the infirmary, an act of compassion that earned them the `[Friend of the Medics]` title. Their official debriefing with Rémi established a new, chilling threat: a cult known as the **"Preservationists"** who followed the Curator's ideology, led by a mysterious "First Follower." The cultural rift, a quiet friction between the pragmatic, community-focused Francophone survivors of Gatineau and some of the more cold, order-obsessed Anglophone arrivals from Ottawa, had provided the perfect cover for the enemy's infiltration. This debriefing also formalized the Citadel's command structure, with Rémi presiding over a council that included Gus of the **Workshop Union** and Leo of the **Aegis Wardens**.

### **Chapter 8: The Traitor Within**

The heroes' newfound peace was shattered days later. Dr. Aris was abducted from within the Citadel, a `Lesser Petrified Core` planted on her, leading her out into the city. An investigation revealed an inside job, orchestrated by a group of survivors from Ottawa led by a scavenger named Silas. The orderly they interviewed remembered the key detail: "The scavenger, Silas, insisted on delivering some blankets himself... brushed right past the doctor in the hall. It was over in a second."

Choosing to secure their home before giving chase, Elizabeth and Manson led a purge, cornering the traitors in the courthouse archives. The fight was swift and claustrophobic. Elizabeth used her `[Shadow Step - Lvl 1]` `[-35 SP]`, and Manson activated his `[Kinetic Pulse]` `[-30 SP]`. Their combined skills made short work of the enemy. The captured leader revealed their name—the "Preservationists"—and their goal: to use Dr. Aris's knowledge to control the petrification process. Their main base, their "Vault," was the Bank of Canada building.

Knowing they faced an intelligent human enemy, they decided to prepare. Crafting a Rare shield was a grueling, all-night affair. Manson worked without rest, the clang of his hammer a constant rhythm in the workshop. He had to meticulously heat and shape the **[Hardened Carapace Plating]** while simultaneously creating a stable housing for the volatile **[Petrified Core]**. It was a test of both his physical endurance and his immense intellect.

By dawn, exhausted but successful, a System notification announced his triumph: `[Item Crafted: Aegis of the Sentinel]`.
`> Type: Shield (Medium Armor)`
`> Quality: Rare`
`> Armor: 25`
`> Durability: 200/200`
`> Effect: +2 Constitution`
`> Active Ability: [Stone Guard] - Costs 40 SP. For 10 seconds, your Armor value is doubled, and you become immune to stagger effects. (Cooldown: 10 minutes)`
`> Crafted by Artificer Manson Thomas.`

Manson was no longer just a craftsman; he was a fortress.

### **Chapter 9: The Vault**

The assault team assembled. The journey to Ottawa was an arduous, multi-hour trek, culminating in a tense nighttime crossing of the Portage Bridge, the dark, icy waters of the Ottawa River churning below. The imposing, modernist silhouette of the Bank of Canada loomed ahead. The plan was audacious: a Trojan Horse. Disguised in enemy gear with a guard pretending to be a prisoner, they bluffed their way past the entrance guards. The gambit was a spectacular success, getting their entire force inside the Mint undetected.

They chose to methodically clear the ground floor, neutralizing patrols with terrifying efficiency, led by Elizabeth's `Mantle`-enhanced stealth. In a security office, they found a map of the enemy's dispositions.

They opted to take the claustrophobic ventilation shafts to bypass the main enemy force. Inside, they came upon a horrifying sight: the Preservationists in the smelting chamber, forging new Sentinels by mixing molten gold with crushed `Petrified Cores`. They were not just a cult; they were a factory. Their path was blocked by an industrial fan, which Manson expertly short-circuited with his **[Deconstruct]** skill.

They emerged from the vents into the antechamber of the vault, right above the First Follower's elite guard: three **[Preservationist Praetorians]**. They initiated the attack with Manson's **[Kinetic Pulse]**.
`[Manson activates [Kinetic Pulse]! -30 SP]`
`[The Praetorians' [Petrified Core] armor absorbs the majority of the concussive force!]`
`[Enemies are inflicted with [Staggered]! Effect duration severely reduced to 2 seconds!]`

A grinding, brutal battle ensued. One of the Praetorians slammed its fists together, activating **[Stone Form]**, its skin becoming like granite. Manson was forced to use **[Stone Guard]** to hold one Praetorian in a one-on-one duel, his shield taking massive blows that shook the entire room.
`[Manson activates [Stone Guard]! -40 SP]`
`[Incoming Damage: 80. Damage Mitigated by [Stone Guard]: 80. HP: 140/140]`

After a vicious struggle that left several of their own guards wounded, the last Praetorian fell.

They were victorious, but battered. They took a crucial moment to heal, using their **[First-Aid Kit]** to stabilize the wounded and prepare for the final confrontation. With the `Key of the First Follower` in hand, they approached the vault door. They opted for a tactical entry: Manson and Leo would form a shield wall at the entrance while the ranged fighters unleashed an opening volley.
